This is a basic "Point of Sales" system where any one can add a product with desciption and price. Then generate a bill or calculate a sale with discounts. The full system is GUI based.

I did it for my undergrade software engineering class as a class project. The basic target was to learn about various software patterns.

Some basic design patterns like GRASP (Information Expert, Creator, High Cohesion, Low Coupling, Controller), GoF (Adapter, Factory, Singleton, Strategy, Composite, Facade, Publisher-Subscriber) were used.

A class diagram of the whole project can be found in "src/edu/northsouth/cse326/POSSystem.png"
